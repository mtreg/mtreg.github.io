      <description>Time for a ChangeI got my original website started in the beginning of grad school (circa 2007), with great help from a college friend. As this one, it was a static webpage, but relied directly CSS and HTML, with no real page generator in the sense of Jekyll or Hugo. It’s been great for me - serving as a place to link other projects I’ve developed; for example, a QGIS tutorial I wrote for a workshop, and materials from a GIS/Spatial Analysis course I taught as a postdoc.</description>
