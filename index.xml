      <description>Time for a ChangeI got my original website started in the beginning of grad school (circa 2007), with great help from a college friend. As this one, it was a static webpage, but relied directly CSS and HTML, with no real page generator in the sense of Jekyll or Hugo. It’s been great for me - serving as a place to link other projects I’ve developed; for example, a QGIS tutorial I wrote for a workshop, and materials from a GIS/Spatial Analysis course I taught as a postdoc.</description>

Current Work My research is broadly focused on using modern statistical and computing tools to inform conservation efforts. I recently started working in New York City, and am using available remote sensing data and GIS datasets to characterize open space dynamics, understand how connected wildlife populations might be across the city, and map previously-unmapped assests, like green roofs. Postdoc Research My main research at the University of Tulsa was focused on understanding how life history traits of amphibians may play into effects of climate change.</description>

      <description>QGIS Tutorial QGIS is a well-developed, open source GIS program, with a wide range of features and great compatability with numerous formats. Furthermore, basic installation includes linkages with other open source GIS tools such as GRASS GIS and SAGA (among others). It is one primary software packages that I use in research and teach in classes.
This tutorial is designed to familiarize GIS users with the general layout, features and tools of QGIS, through working with sample datasets that are provided.</description>
