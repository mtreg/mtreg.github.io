Current Work My research is broadly focused on using modern statistical and computing tools to inform conservation efforts. I recently started working in New York City, and am using available remote sensing data and GIS datasets to characterize open space dynamics, understand how connected wildlife populations might be across the city, and map previously-unmapped assests, like green roofs. Postdoc Research My main research at the University of Tulsa was focused on understanding how life history traits of amphibians may play into effects of climate change.</description>
